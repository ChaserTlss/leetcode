# REPO DESCRIBE
A c-language trainning repo.
Most of them are some question at leetcode that I need debug.
But I did not buy the `Plus` at leetcode, So I build a local debug environment.

## file name
lc{leecode's question ID}[\_{version number begin from 1}].c

## compile
./compiler.sh filename

## run without debug
./a.out

## debug
gdb a.out

## run all c file
./run_all.sh

## commit format
```git commit
file_name: question topic

commit
```
